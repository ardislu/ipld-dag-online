# ipld-dag-online

This is a minimal webpage for quickly using [js-dag-pb](https://github.com/ipld/js-dag-pb), [js-dag-json](https://github.com/ipld/js-dag-json), and [js-dag-cbor](https://github.com/ipld/js-dag-cbor) online without installing or setting up anything.

It imports all three libraries and exposes it to DevTools. There's also a minimal UI to quickly select a file for further manipulation.
